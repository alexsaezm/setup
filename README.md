This is how I configure my machines. And a work in progress.
Currently, Fedora and MacOSX (OSs that I use in my workstations) are configure exactly in the same way.

## how to use it

> If you have `NOPASSWD:ALL` in your `/etc/sudoers` file, the better.

```bash
$ make
```

## What's the lab target?
I usually test stuff on RHEL, lab is the name of the Ansible group of the
machines I have available for an specific bug.
